# Robot_fusion_2021

This is repository of new AGV platform made by "SKN Fusion" academic circle.

Main platform features:
  1. Mapping based on own algorithm used to autonomus driving.
  2. Communication in software, between RPi 4  and Arduino based on ROS messages (Rosserial, Rosmaster...)
  3. Optimized and improved codes compared to previous project of AGV platform.
  4. Optionally implementation of neural network for image classification.
